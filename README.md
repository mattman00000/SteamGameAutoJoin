# SteamGameAutoJoin

Displays room number on resume button.
Adds an entry field and an "Auto Join" button to the lobby page for the Steam Summer Monster Minigame.
Will try to connect to the specified room and will enter the room when successful (unlike other autojoin spamming scripts).

## Usage
Adds a text field and two buttons to the join game (lobby) page of the Steam minigame. Type the desired room number into the box and click "AutoJoin room." Script will continue to try joining the room and capture errors. Stops automatically when the room is full or if you cannot join for other reasons (too high level, or previously left the room). Click the stop button at any time to manually stop the script from running and enter a new room number.
